This is a project i made to practice what i have learned
from the 100 days of code.
A python course by Angela Yu, day 31.

This project is a fantasy name generator,
where the user first makes some choices (sex of character) and then
gets three names suggested.
After this, the user might choose to add a title or place-name.
ALl names are generated by using Chat gpt, and does include names that are trademarked.
You should therefore not use this generator for anything other than private use.
Some examples might be:

Habba the Happy

Ivar von Heimdal

Hildegun the Strong
