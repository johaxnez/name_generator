# name_generator
Fantasy name generator made using tkinter. 
The names were generated using Chat GPT. Pictures are not my own work. 
The point of this project was to use what i have learned from Angela Yu's Udemy python course (up to day 31) in a project of my own making. 
The use of Pandas is redundant. It would have been easier to ask Chat GPT to format the names into lists, stored them in a nother py.file and importing said file. 
Then i could have used list comprehesion to choose a random name and combining it with a random place/attribute. 

I also wanted to simulate going to another page, that's why the "about" function and page is formated the way it is.
